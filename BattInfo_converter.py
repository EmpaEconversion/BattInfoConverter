BattINFO converter helps you ontologize the metadata of your coin cell batteries based on the [BattINFO ontology](https://github.com/BIG-MAP/BattINFO).
Ontologizing your metadata significantly enhances the interoperability of your data across various digital platforms and research groups.
To learn more about ontologizing your metadata, we invite you to visit our page on [ontologizing metadata](https://github.com/ord-premise/interoperability-guidelines/tree/main).
While there are many benefits of this process, it can be a daunting task in practice. With this in mind,
we developed the open-source [BattINFO converter](https://github.com/EmpaEconversion/BattInfoConverter) web application designed to streamline and expedite this intricate task, making it more manageable for you and your team.  

BattINFO converter converts an Excel file collecting the metadata of a coin cell battery from the user into a fully ontologized JSON-LD file,
which can be published as supporting information with your scientific publication or in open-access data repositories such as [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org).
Example Excel metadata files for a coin cell battery are provided. We plan to add more Excel metadata files for other cell types in the future. 
For additional infor-mation on how to fill the Excel file, please click the respective link on the left.  

BattINFO converter web application was developed by Dr. Nukorn Plainpan and Prof. Dr. Corsin Battaglia at [Empa](https://www.empa.ch/), the Swiss Federal Laboratories
for Materials Science and Technology in the Laboratory [Materials for Energy Conversion](https://www.empa.ch/web/s501). We acknowledge stimulating discussions and support from
Dr. Simon Clark, SINTEF. BattINFO converter also  acknowledges support from the European Unionâ€™s Horizon research and innovation program under
grant agreements No. 957189 ([BIG-MAP](https://www.big-map.eu/) project), No. 957213 ([Battery2030+](https://battery2030.eu/) coordination and support action 2),
