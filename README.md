## Overview

**BattINFO Converter** is a Python-based web application that simplifies the semantic annotation of battery metadata. It converts coin cell battery metadata from an Excel-based schema into a **JSON-LD** format using the [BattINFO ontology](https://github.com/BIG-MAP/BattINFO), ensuring standardized and machine-readable metadata. This tool is designed for non-technical users, eliminating the need for manual JSON-LD creation. Researchers only need to fill in an Excel schema (visit BattINFO converter to learn more), and the converter automates the transformation process, enhancing data interoperability, reproducibility, and [FAIRness](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/). By adopting **BattINFO Converter**, research groups can ensure that their battery metadata is structured, shareable, and reusable, facilitating better collaboration and advancing battery research.
